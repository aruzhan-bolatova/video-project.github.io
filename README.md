# Project Description
Welcome to the procrastinator's haven! Due Date is Do Date is an interactive website that dives into the chaotic realm of a university student desperately dodging an impending assignment deadline. The project revolves around the struggle of procrastination, capturing the balance between academic duties and the siren call of delay. Despite facing challenges with audio equipment availability, our team was able to craft an immersive experience that puts you in the shoes of a master procrastinator. This project is not just any journey; it's a compilation of several clips showcasing the art of procrastination over random/relatable things. It kicks off with an introduction video where our group members gather to begin discussing the project. The adventure concludes with everyone collectively stressing and summing up the entire procrastination project.

Meet the Procrastinators:

Sara: Sara's first option involves doing chores as a way to escape from work. From grocery shopping to stress eating, she goes all out. Her second option? Heading to the unix lab to get some work done, but ending up distracted with doodles.

Alreem: Alreem's first option is all about traveling and spending the entire day vacationing instead of working. Her second option? Indulging in some serious shopping and exploring every shop imaginable rather than finishing up the assignment.

Diana: Diana's first option leads her to the "Baraha," where she gets distracted with games like pool, ping pong, and hockey. Her second option involves getting ready for a date, adding a romantic twist to her procrastination saga.

Aruzha: Aruzhan's first option includes vlogging and endlessly scrolling on social media. Her second option? Opting for a nap or a good night's sleep to completely avoid work.

# Process
We started the process of the work with intense discussions about the main idea of the video. We agreed on the point that the work should be creative and comedic. As procrastination is something relatable for most of us, we decided to go with this idea and show the procrastination ways for four of the characters. Inspired by the Netflix movies with the user input, we decided to have a similar approach, so the users will have a chance to go through the videos in their own way. For that, we agreed to create two options of procrastination for each of the characters, so they will be able to choose how the characters will procrastinate. After that, we discussed the logic of the website such as how to make it interactive, which pages to open, and which variation of the website will be the best. When the rough idea was done, we worked on the main part such as the script, shooting of 14 pieces of video, and website coding. Each of them had their own challenges and takeaways. 

# Reflection/Evaluation
Reflecting on the work done, we encountered issues and challenges in almost every step of the project. Starting with the script, it was a little difficult to come up with 8 different ways of procrastinating since for the majority of us they are the same. It was a creative challenge we overcame through intense discussions. Then, during the shooting of the video, we had many technical challenges connected with the video quality, motion, and sound. First, as we wanted to make our video more dynamic and in the style of the realistic shows, it was hard to manipulate the professional camera because of its staticity and the manual focus. Because of changing the settings many times and moving the camera, we decided to go with the iPhone as it is the best for our style of film: autofocus, mobility, and lightness. In addition to that, the professional camera did have issues with the sound, and in order to fix that we had to get the microphones. However, after spying on the equipment center website for three days in a row and not being able to get a single microphone, we couldnâ€™t go with the professional camera. 
Furthermore, the coding part had its own challenges and we are certain that we grew up by overcoming them. First, as mentioned above, figuring out the logic of the website structure was a bit challenging such as whether to open a new tab with a button clicked, or to make the page scroll down etc. During the process of coding, there were some issues with the design of the website such as not being able to make the button designs as aesthetic as we wanted and making them a little dynamic from the first trial. However, by some explanation of the logic and debugging with the help of each other, we could solve those issues. Last but not least, loading the videos to GitHub had its own issues as it took a lot of time and reloading because of the quality decrease.
