# Project Description
Welcome to the procrastinator's haven! Due Date is Do Date is an interactive website that dives into the chaotic realm of a university student desperately dodging an impending assignment deadline. The project revolves around the struggle of procrastination, capturing the balance between academic duties and the siren call of delay. Despite facing challenges with audio equipment availability, our team was able to craft an immersive experience that puts you in the shoes of a master procrastinator. This project is not just any journey; it's a compilation of several clips showcasing the art of procrastination over random/relatable things. It kicks off with an introduction video where our group members gather to begin discussing the project. The adventure concludes with everyone collectively stressing and summing up the entire procrastination project.

Meet the Procrastinators:

Sara: Sara's first option involves doing chores as a way to escape from work. From grocery shopping to stress eating, she goes all out. Her second option? Heading to the unix lab to get some work done, but ending up distracted with doodles.

Alreem: Alreem's first option is all about traveling and spending the entire day vacationing instead of working. Her second option? Indulging in some serious shopping and exploring every shop imaginable rather than finishing up the assignment.

Diana: Diana's first option leads her to the "Baraha," where she gets distracted with games like pool, ping pong, and hockey. Her second option involves getting ready for a date, adding a romantic twist to her procrastination saga.

Aruzha: Aruzhan's first option includes vlogging and endlessly scrolling on social media. Her second option? Opting for a nap or a good night's sleep to completely avoid work.

# Process
Our journey kicked off with many brainstorming sessions, sketching out many procrastination scenarios and decision points for website interactivity. Originally planning for an audio-centric experience, we pivoted due to equipment limitations, refocusing on vibrant visual and text-based comic elements to keep the essence intact. The design phase unfolded into a canvas of lively graphics and comic-style animations, ensuring your adventure remains captivating and immersive. Each element was carefully crafted to guide you through the procrastination of this very assignment!

# Reflection/Evaluation
While the original plan took an unexpected turn, the adaptive approach regarding audio resulted in a unique and engaging experience. Due Date is Do Date not only met but exceeded our goals!
